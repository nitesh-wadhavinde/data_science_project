open anaconda prompt
cd project path
code . which opens vs code instance
now open terminal in vscode
creating new environment
conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
cls  clear screen
conda activate venv/

next we need to clone this repo and sync with github


this ode would be available on GitHub once you create repo:
echo "# data_science_project" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md

now use git config user.email "email"
git config user.name "username"

git commit -m "first commit"


now we need to push this file

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/nitesh-wadhavinde/data_science_project.git
git push -u origin main


goto GitHub and create a new file with name .gitignore hen choose python and commit changes

now to get updated stuff on remote use git pull

now in vscode create a new file setup.py and requirements.txt
with help of setup.py we will be able to build our application as a package and even deploy in pypi

in setup.py:
from setuptools import find_packages,setup
from typing import List
def get_requirements(file_path:str)->List[str]:
	'''
	this func will return list of requirements
	'''
	requirements=[]
	with open(file_path) as file_obj:
		requirements=file_obj.readlines()
		requirements=[req.replace("\n","") for req in requirements]
	

setup(
name='mlproject',
version='0.0.1',
author='Nitesh',
author_email='niteshwadhavinde.nw@gmail.com',
packages=find_packages(),
install_requires=get_requirements('requirements.txt')
)



for setup.py how will it be able to able to find packages and all
for this what we do is create a src folder with __init__.py


so when we are trying to install all in requirements.txt it should run setup.py
to that we add 
-e . in requirements.txt 

now to make sure that the lit we made before removes this -e .
we add below condition o our function get_req
if '-e .' in requirements:
 requirements.remove('-e .')



2.Src folder with package
pip install -r requirements.txt
done
